# Show Kerning Group Reference

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays all members of the currently acive glyph’s kerning group to either side in minitaure. This can be usefull if you are flipping through your glyphs and immedeately need a visual reference of how your kerning groups look like. If you see elements sticking out of the righthandside group, you know there might be a group member set wrong. Same for th left side. It works best when used with a single glyph, but it is designed to at least work okay-ish in strings of text. It is somehow related to the built-in feature "Show Group Members" by Georg Seifert, but this one does not need the caret to sit between a certain pair. Since it works in real time, you will get instant feedback when you define kerning groups in the edit view.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `ShowKerningGroupReference.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
