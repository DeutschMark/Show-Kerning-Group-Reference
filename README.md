# Show Kerning Group Reference

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It simply visualizes the base glyph which is set as the kerning group for the currently active glyph. The left one to the left, the right one to the – well, you got it. This can be usefull if you are flipping through your glyphs and immedeately need a visual reference of how your kerning groups look like. It works best when used with a single glyph, but it is designed to at least work okay-ish in strings of text. If you call your kerning groups anything that does not exist in your font, it will not show anything there of course. Since it works in real time, you will get instant feedback when you define kerning groups in the edit view.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `ShowKerningGroupReference.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
